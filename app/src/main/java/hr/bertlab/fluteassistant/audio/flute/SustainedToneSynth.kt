/**
 * A flute voice ([FluteTimbre]) that does not know its length in advance: [noteOn] fades the
 * note in over [ATTACK_MS] and holds it, [noteOff] fades it out over [RELEASE_MS], and a
 * [noteOn] while a note sounds fades the old note down over [RETRIGGER_MS] before the new
 * attack, so nothing clicks. The oscillator is phase-continuous across every change.
 * [render] fills PCM blocks on demand and writes zeros while [isSilent]. Pure Kotlin, one
 * thread at a time (the player's render thread drives it through a command queue).
