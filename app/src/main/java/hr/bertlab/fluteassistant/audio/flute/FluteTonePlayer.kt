/**
 * One flute voice for the flute tab: a note sounds from [noteOn] until [noteOff], and a new
 * [noteOn] takes the voice over. [open] is called when the tab appears, so the output is
 * already running (silent) and the first press is not late; [close] when the tab is no longer
 * visible, so nothing plays or drains the battery in the background. [noteOn] on a closed
 * player opens it first, so a late [open] is never fatal. Every call returns at once.
