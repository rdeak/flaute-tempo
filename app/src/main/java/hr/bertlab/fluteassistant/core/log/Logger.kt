package hr.bertlab.fluteassistant.core.log

/**
 * Structured app logging. Every line is a dotted event name plus `key=value` fields (see
 * [LogLine]) under a per-subsystem tag from [LogTags], so `adb logcat -s FA.Tuner` shows one
 * subsystem and a script can split lines on spaces. Levels follow Android's:
 * - `v`: per-frame detail, off unless enabled for the tag at runtime with
 *   `adb shell setprop log.tag.FA.Tuner VERBOSE`; guard anything costly with [isVerbose],
 * - `d`: periodic summaries and state changes, on in debug builds (or per tag with `setprop`),
 * - `i`: lifecycle (a microphone opened, a session started), always on,
 * - `w` / `e`: failures, always on, with the exception when there is one.
